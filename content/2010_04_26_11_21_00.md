# Sharepoint : Custom redirection HttpModule based on UserProfile Property

When a request is made to an ASP.NET application, an instance of HttpApplication class is made to process this request. One instance of the HttpApplication class can process multiple requests during its lifetime, however only one at a time.

When the request is being processed, the application raises a chain of events on to which an implementation of IHttpModule can be hooked on.

If you don’t know about HttpApplication class and the chain of events, please look [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.httpapplication.aspx).

If you don’t know about IHttpModule interface, please look [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ihttpmodule.aspx).

Assuming that you are developing for Sharepoint 2007.

Install WSPBuilder on Visual Studio from [here](http://wspbuilder.codeplex.com/).

1. Create new WSPBuilder Project in Visual Studio.
2. Add Sharepoint Resources : Microsoft.Office.Server.dll and Microsoft.Sharepoint.dll
3. Write a class which implement interface IHttpModule. 
4. "PostAuthenticateRequest" is a EventHandler to which you can add an event (delegate) which here is fulfilled by OnAuthenticationCustomRedirect.

The HttpModule’s functionality is to redirect a user based on user’s chosen user profile property. To redirect the user or to write in the event logs on the server, the commands need to be run with elevated privileges and that is exactly what the private functions do.

The redirection happens only if the request is coming from a different host. If surfing within the website the redirection will not take place. This is done by comparing the hosts of the incoming url from current request and the previous url from previous request.

If you don't know about accessing previous urls, please look [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.httprequest.urlreferrer.aspx).

If the Sharepoint user doesn’t exist and <i>userProfileManager.GetUserProfile(“name”)</i> is called. An exception is thrown. This is the reason why the module is under try-catch block. If such an error occurs then an error is recorded in the Event Log on the server.

By comparing the value of the properties, we can then redirect the user in a customized manner.
