# Machinery.AI Developer Conference (Seattle, WA)

Today, I attended the Machinery.AI Developer Conference in Seattle, WA. Highlights : 

- Affordable. $60 registration ($10 parking, and if you are taking 520, $4.50 toll charge each way.)
- Thanks to Capital One, free swag is always cool ! (fidget spinner on a pen ?! :satisfied:)
